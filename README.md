# Router
A program that helps find potential routes with a stop added between two points


This program was written for a particular company, but can probably be modified for a variety of applications. I had to remove some infromation due to privacy issues, but I will always try to include a dummy excel file as well as make notes of where certain parameters need to be changed in order to be functional. This application was built using ArcGIS from Esri, but in theory any serivce which can generate routes should work. In order to use this code, you'll  have to have an Esri account. The biggest limitation of this code is that it is restricted by the number of credits available to the ArcGIS account. For any questions or comments, please contact me at evanwb50@gmail.com.
